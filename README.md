# weather-dashboard

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a weather forcast for a city that the user
enters using the weather api. The site then stores the previously entered city's
information so it can pop up again at the user's convinence. No style file was needed because of bootstrap. This project is currently incomplete because of issues loading from local storage and icons issues.

### Additional Libraries
- Weather api
- Bootstrap 4-3-1 for css
